3D-Position
===========

Some fooling around with a game idea.

Very rudimentary input and output via the console with the player being represented by the @.

Movement in the x, y, and z directions are possible, as long as there are no walls (#) in the way.
After the first keystroke, the views on each axis, from the @'s perspective, are represented by horizontal lines. The @ has no peripheral vison, only directly forward and back on each axis.

Controls:
* h - One block lower on the x axis
* l - One block higher on the x axis
* j - One block lower on the y axis
* k - One block higher on the y axis
* J - One block lower on the y axis
* K - One block higher on the y axis
* q - Quit
